This is a repository of work on the public use file of the National Study of Child Health, 2011-2012. This work uses data made available through agreement from the Data Resource Center for Child and Adolescent Health (http://www.childhealthdata.org/help/dataset).

The scripts are written in R and R markdown, and the required packages include the survey, knitr and ProjectTemplate packages.

Run the eda.R file in the /src folder first and this will load the data and run the initial munge script. Exploratory analyses are in /src/exploratory.Rmd
